### Motivation

Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, a range of conspiracy theories and pseudo-intellectual arguments have spun up around the globe about the scope and severity of the pandemic. The [President of The United States](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-donald-trump-ap-fact-check-anthony-fauci-flu-fe474f0c15f76adf324791a2cfc1e2bb) has repeatedly compared coronavirus to the flu, claiming that the lethality of the two diseases are comparable. While public health professionals can quickly dismiss these statements as nonsensical absurdities, they are actually not unusual opinions amongst the general public. As the daily COVID Death toll reaching new heights in the United States, 30% of Americans are still [not concerned](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/) with the virus according to the newest tracking poll from Fivethirtyeight. One major talking point of many COVID skeptics is that they believe the COVID-19's death toll is inflated by hospital reporting other diseases under the name of COVID-19 - therefore, COVID-19 has not increased total mortality rate dramatically.

In addition, as the pandemic had  worn on, the general public has grown increasingly skeptical of the preventive measures that public health officials are promoting throughout the developed world, the idea that ["lockdowns kill people"](https://www.radiologybusiness.com/topics/policy/scott-atlas-radiologist-white-house-covid-19-fauci) has been picked up by an increasingly large portions of pundits, activists and elected officials alike. Opponents of lockdowns claim that these restrictions have significant negative impacts on other aspects of public health, and those consequences vastly outweigh the the supposed benefits that these preventive measures are intended for. One of the most notable proponents of a "return to normal" approach is an organization named the [Great Barrington Declaration](https://gbdeclaration.org/), a group of epidemiologists and doctors who believe that reaching herd immunity instead of curbing the immediate spread of the virus is the "more compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits".
