# The tentative project title

  - Excess deaths and COVID-19

# The motivation for this project

  - Our intended motivation is to create a website to communicate
    information on the COVID-19 epidemic. More specifically, we would
    like to focus on excess deaths.

# The intended final products

  - We intend to create a website to display COVID-19 data. This website
    will include multiple graphs and data visualizations in order to
    better understand the impact of the COIVD-19 epidemic and overall
    excess deaths due to COVID-19.

# The anticipated data sources

  - We will be initially using a data source from the CDC. This data
    source displays information excess deaths associated with COVID-19.
